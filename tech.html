                    <li>Farmers no longer have to apply water, fertilizers, and pesticides uniformly across entire fields. Instead, they can use the minimum quantities required and target very specific areas, or even treat individual plants differently. Benefits include:

                        <li>Higher crop productivity
                            Decreased  use of water, fertilizer, and pesticides, which in turn keeps food prices down
                            Reduced impact on natural ecosystems
                            Less runoff of chemicals into rivers and groundwater
                            Increased worker safety
                            In addition, robotic technologies enable more reliable monitoring and management of natural resources, such as air and water quality.

                    </li>
                    <li> It also gives producers greater control over plant and animal production, processing, distribution, and storage, which results in:
                    
                        Greater efficiencies and lower prices
                        Safer growing conditions and safer foods
                        Reduced environmental and ecological impact
                        Improved crop health through reduced exposure to harmful pathogens
                        More accurate weather forecasts for farmers
                        Better management of the timing of planting, sowing, weeding, harvesting, etc., leading to more consistent yields</li>
